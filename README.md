# Sassmine
Sassmine is a collection of mixins available for you to create unit tests in Sass. Inspired by Jasmine for JavaScript unit testing, Sassmine makes use of similiar naming for it's mixins as Jasmine does for it's functions. 

At the moment Sassmine compiles test results to a CSS file. The test results will, in the not so distant future, be output and formatted to the console. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** Documentation updates and changes still to follow.
